# rustword

A recreation of the game Wordle written in rust. This is a project to learn the rust programming language.

## Setup

This repository already has the words saved in hte `words` folder. But if you want to add your own words you can do so by removing the existing the `<number>.txt` files and replacing your words in the `allWords.txt` file. Then run the python script inside of the folder `words`.

## TODOS

- [ ] Make the board array a vector so the user can enter the number of letter of the word.
